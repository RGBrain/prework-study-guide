# Study Guide Webpage
A study guide for course prework


# <Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

While learning front-end development there is a great deal to remember.  This webpage provides some useful facts regarding:

- HTML
- CSS
- Git
- JavaScript


## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This guide is designed as an accompaniment to the prework which serves as preparation to my front-end web development bootcamp.

You can simply read through the notes for each topic, although there is another option for those seeking inspiration:

  Open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.


## Credits

The creation of this guide was part of the prework itself, and detailed guidance was provided.

In addition, I followed this [Professional README guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide)




## License

I have used The MIT License (see repo) as it is the most widely used open source license as of this writing. 

It is a permissive license, so it doesn't have much by way of requirements.  In addition, it is well-known and facilitates re-use in other projects.

## Tests

  I haven't been able to exhaustively test all possible screen-sizes/OS/browser combinations. As this is a static webpage, there isn't a great deal of functionality to test, However, I'd be grateful to hear of any problems with the appearance you experience.
